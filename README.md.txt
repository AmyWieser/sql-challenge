SQL CHALLENGE

I was given the task shortly after being hired by Pewlett Hackard as a data engineer to research the employee records from the 1980’s and 1990’s by analyzing 6 CSV Files

In this repository you will find the database structure and relationships amongst the tables in the ERD Diagram.

You will also find the schema SQL queries for the table structures.

Lastly you will find the data analysis SQL queries for the following data anlaysis:

• The following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
• First name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
• The manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
• The department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
• The first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
• All employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
• All employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
• In descending order, the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
